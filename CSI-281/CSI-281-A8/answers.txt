1.)
it depends, breadth first is better for certain parts however, 
depth first would be better if we need to search the entire graph
2.)
O(|v| + |e|)
worst case does every vertex and edge explaining O(v+e) and its absolute value 
to ensure its positive
3.)
the adjacency list stores less data overall, only storing known connections
4.)
The Highway system like how google maps or ways works.
