1.)O(1), because even though its still being filled with random numbers, 
it still takes a constant time

2.)O(N), because the location inside the array is random and theres
no way to predict that

3.) 12 * N * log(n)base 2
12N * log(n)base 2
120,000log(120000)base n

16.8

2,016,000

4.) tuple
    array
    linked list
